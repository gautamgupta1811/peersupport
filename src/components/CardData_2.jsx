      `Q. Good morning Apurva, we are contacting you from Peer Support. How have you been?
    `,
      `Ans. Good morning to you too, I’ve been doing well.
    `,
      `Q. Tell us more about yourself.
    `,
      `Ans. My name is Apurva Tidke. I am from Nagpur. I did my early schooling back in Nagpur, further, I pursued my engineering degree in Computer Science from KITS College.  After that I started preparing for UPSC Civil Services Examination. I have devoted 7 years of my life preparing for UPSC. During this period I have also worked in a company called Cactus Communications where I edited research papers from all over the globe. I am inclined towards literature and content from the beginning and have published a novel. After my stint with Cactus, I started working as a VARC trainer. I taught VARC at TIME Ludhiana and then joined Tarkashastra (Pune) as the Study Abroad Head. During COVID years I worked as a mentor for UPSC aspirants on an online platform.
 
    `,
      `Q. You have mentioned something regarding publishing a novel, could you shed some light on that aspect?`,
      `Ans. Yes, I am a published novelist. I have written a novel called ‘Fantasy Girl’ which explores the themes of patriarchy and women's role in society where I have tried to offer a nuanced perspective with respect to how injustice against women is a societal issue, not an individual woman’s issue.`,
      `Q. Being a married woman as well as a working professional, how did you manage CAT preparation along with your family and job?
    `,
      `Ans. As I have mentioned VARC has been one of my strengths. I tried to capitalize as much as possible in this section and manage the other two. For LRDI and Quants, I followed Arun Sharma’s books. Here I applied a selective approach of choosing the sections yielding more questions in CAT. I tried to focus more on them. I used to give mocks regularly although the frequency used to get hampered due to exhaustion from non-academic areas. While giving mocks I used to attempt maximum questions in VARC and select the easier and moderate questions in LRDI and Quants. After every mock, the most important part is to analyze them. If I faced any difficulty in any subject or regarding any preparation, I approached my colleagues or friends and asked for help. They have always motivated, helped, and guided me throughout this journey.
    `,
      `Q5. How tough was the interview for different IITs? What were some of the intriguing questions that were asked to you?
    `,
      `Ans. The interview approach differs for different colleges. In IIT Madras, the interview was subject-oriented where I was asked questions related to statistics and other subjects. The interview for IIT Delhi was personality-oriented, where they asked me questions related to my published novel and my work experience. They began with HR questions like why MBA, and future goals. Then they asked:
    -        What was the thought process involved in writing the novel?
    -        How work experience helped me become a better person and what qualities did I pick up from it?
    -        Since you have completed long back do you look at yourself as an engineer?
     
    `,
      `Q. Why IIT Delhi?
    `,
      `Ans: IIT Delhi is one of the top-notch B-schools in the country which is consistently growing. This itself opens multiple opportunities in the sphere of management. Apart from my inclination towards literature and content, I have an interest in technology. In my work experience, I used to edit research articles. The technical bent motivated me to pursue my MBA from an ecosystem providing management knowledge with exposure to technology. Location and connectivity are also some of the major factors and Delhi catered nicely to it.
    `,
      `Q. What would be your perspective on the culture of IIT, Delhi? 
    `,
      `Ans.- IIT Delhi is considered to be one of the premier institutes for multiple disciplines including management. The infrastructure of IIT Delhi is top-notch. The faculty have a meticulous understanding of the subjects they teach and know their practical application. Overall, learning with talented peers in such an environment fosters the growth and refinement of a person’s acumen.
    `,
      `Q. How was the shift from preparing for the Civil Services Examination to preparing for CAT and working in the management field?
    `,
      `Ans. - There is a major difference in approach in bureaucracy and management field. In management you have to network, you have to be able to shift attention in short bursts, and you need to have an understanding of social media and learn to use it effectively, all of which I was not used to. During your UPSC preparation, you isolate yourself, minimize your distractions, and focus the number of hours on your study.
    The perspective of a problem changes. As a UPSC aspirant, you tend to have an idealistic attitude concerned with the development of your constituency and people which you need to adjust while working in management. You have to adapt and learn from others. While some skills of UPSC like managing time, being updated, and learning new things every day can help you, however, you still have to acquire engaging communication skills and start visualizing things from a different perspective.
    Overall, being flexible helped me the most as I could adjust to the demands of a changed curriculum.

      `Q1. Good evening, Sandeep. My name is Shreya Swain, your interviewer from Peer Support for the day. Tell me a little about yourself.
    Ans: Good evening, Shreya, my name is Sandeep Kumar Singh. Currently, I am pursuing my MBA in DoMS, IIT Madras. I have completed my B.Tech from Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology, Burla from the Department of Electrical Engineering. I used to work at Principal Global Services (PGS) after my bachelor's before Joining for an MBA degree.`,

      `Q2. That’s impressive. What was the main reason behind the switch of careers from PGS to a full-term MBA degree?
    Ans: Though I had received a well-paying job after my bachelor's degree, the prospect of a management course had always appealed to me. After I came across the idea of the CAT, I started preparing for it immediately. 
    One of my biggest motivations is my perseverance in management. I was leading the Students’ Cultural Association of my college. During that period, I got the opportunity to deal with multiple organizations regarding sponsorship and work with many teams to manage the event smoothly. I got a taste of management and wanted to explore it further from a broader perspective of corporate.`,

      `Q3. How was the entire process of MBA selection in IITs?
    Ans: IITs generally roll out their form separately. After the declaration of CAT results, you can find the application link on their website. You have to give all the details regarding your profile. Then there they used to ask 3-4 questions based on your career goals, the objective of joining an MBA, and questions resembling your SOP.
    After you get shortlisted here, you will be called for the WAT/PI process which will be held at 5 different nodal centers. You can choose your center accordingly. The WAT revolves around general topics or current issues. For me, it was ‘How EV as Public transport can help in attaining sustainability’. Then you will be headed towards your Interview panel where you will be interviewed and then the final verdict comes up through your mail.`,

      `Q4. Could you please mention some of your interview questions to our readers?
    Ans: Yes sure, my interview generally revolved around my work-ex. They asked me about my current company, their net worth, my role in detail, and our competitors. Then they asked about the technology I was working in and I mentioned it to be Salesforce. Then they started asking about Salesforce, how it operates, the different clouds, and who are the competitors of Salesforce. Then they asked some HR questions regarding why MBA despite having a job, which section you enjoyed the most in CAT, why is your VARC score not good, and which companies you are willing to join in placements. Some general questions around it like when I mentioned about Food Processing and Energy company they asked me to give some examples around it and asked for the reason behind choosing them.`,

      `Q5. How would you describe your experience as a student of MBA in IIT, Madras?
